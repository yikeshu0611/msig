Description: The Molecular Signatures Database ('MSigDB') is one of the most widely 
    used and comprehensive databases of gene sets for performing gene set 
    enrichment analysis <doi:10.1016/j.cels.2015.12.004>. The 'msig' package provides 
    you with powerful, easy-to-use and flexible query functions for the 'MsigDB' 
    database.
        There are 2 query modes in the 'msig' package: online query and local query. 
    Both queries contain 2 steps: gene set name and gene.
        The online search is divided into 2 modes: registered search and 
    non-registered browse. For registered search, email that you registered should 
    be provided.
        Local queries can be made from local database, which can be updated by msig_update() function.
